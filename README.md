# Revealing mesocale structures of time-varying networks through non-negative tensor factorization

This is the repository for the notebooks were we show how the method presented in [1] can be applied to data about face-to-face proximity relations collected in a school.

The notebook with steps to load the data and apply non-negative tensor factorization is [ntf_school.ipynb](ntf_school.ipynb).

The data with class mapping and time-varying proximity interactions are available in the `/data` folder. This is pre-processed data (with the nights removed) in csv (comma-separated values) format. The detailed description of the data can be found in [2]. The original data (without any filtering) can be found in [3].
