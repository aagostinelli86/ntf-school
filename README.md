# Revealing mesocale structures of time-varying networks through non-negative tensor factorization

This is the repository for the notebooks were we show how the method presented in [1] can be applied to data about face-to-face proximity relations collected in a school.

The notebook with steps to load the data and apply non-negative tensor factorization is [ntf_school.ipynb](ntf_school.ipynb).
